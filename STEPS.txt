1. Create directory for the module - dino_roar
2. Create info.yml - dino_roar.info.yml
3. Enable the modoule in extends
4. Define the route - create dino_roar.routing.yml
    start with internal name for route (name doesn't matter) - dino_says:
    indent next line 2  spaces (be consistent)
    add path - url for new page
    add defaults with _controller - this is the controller it goes to when someone hits the page (namespaced class and method)
    add requirements with _permission, which allows us to view the page. Don't need quotes, but it is safer to do so.
