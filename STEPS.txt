1. Create directory for the module - dino_roar
2. Create info.yml - dino_roar.info.yml
3. Enable the modoule in extends
4. Define the route - create dino_roar.routing.yml
    start with internal name for route (name doesn't matter) - dino_says:
    indent next line 2  spaces (be consistent)
    add path - url for new page
    add defaults with _controller - this is the controller it goes to when someone hits the page (namespaced class and method)
    add requirements with _permission, which allows us to view the page. Don't need quotes, but it is safer to do so.
5. Create the controller
    Create directory src and subdirectory Controller
    Create new PHP class called RoarController.php
    Add namespace. Must start with Drupal, the directory (dino_roar) and then the directory this class lives in (Controller)
    Add a class. Class name must match filename + php
    With the namespace and correct classname, Drupal won't be able to find the class.
    Full class name is Drupal\dino_roar\Controller\RoarController
    Add controller function roar().
    Return via Symfony's Response method. Will autocomplete the use statement. This is required when using a class. Will get page not found without it.
    This shows a response by itself - unthemed. You could return a JSON reponse via an API. 
6. Install Drupal Console
    curl -LSs http://drupalconsole.com/installer | php
    mv console.phar /usr/local/bin/drupal
    drupal
    Show all Drupal Console commands: drupal list
    Clear routing cache: drupal router:rebuild





Notes
    Indentation, curly-braces uses PSR-4 coding standards, which is different to offical Drupal standards
